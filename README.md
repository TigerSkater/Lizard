# 🦎 Lizard Button Website

A playful single-page site with a big round button.  
Every time you click the lizard button:
- It plays a "lizard" sound.
- The button looks like it's being pressed.
- The press counter goes up.

## 📂 Files

- `index.html` — Main page containing button, styles, and JavaScript.
- `lizard.mp3` — Your audio file saying "lizard".
- `README.md` — This file.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Place `index.html` and `lizard.mp3` in the same folder.
2. Double-click `index.html` to open it in your browser.
3. Click the 🦎 button and enjoy.

## ⚙️ Customization

- **Sound**: Replace `lizard.mp3` with any audio you like (keep the filename the same, or update the `<audio>` tag `src` in `index.html`).
- **Button Size**: Change the `width` and `height` in the CSS under `#lizardButton`.
- **Emoji/Icon**: Replace the 🦎 in the HTML button element.

## 📝 Notes

- Works entirely offline — no internet required.
- Designed to be very lightweight and portable.
- Audio restarts instantly if you click multiple times quickly.
